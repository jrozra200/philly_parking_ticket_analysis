There are two scripts here. The first, parking_tickets.R, was used to gather the data to put together this blog post: https://jakelearnsdatascience.wordpress.com/2016/03/10/exploring-open-data-philadelphia-parking-violations/.

The other script, predicting_tickets.R, was used to predict the amount of tickets issued in a day based on several factors. This, too, is a blog post: https://jakelearnsdatascience.wordpress.com/2016/03/16/exploring-open-data-part-ii-predicting-the-amount-of-violations-per-day/

I've included the tableau workbooks and the pictures generated by tableau, too, if you are interested. Also, all of the images generated by the R scripts and used in the blog posts are here. 

Lastly, there is the raw data (data.tar.xz) which was used to do all of tha analysis in both scripts and the gis data (gis_data.csv) used in tableau to build the maps you see here.
