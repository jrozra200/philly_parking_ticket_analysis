There are two scripts here. The first, parking_tickets.R, was used to gather the data to put together this blog post: https://jakelearnsdatascience.wordpress.com/2016/03/10/exploring-open-data-philadelphia-parking-violations/.

The other script, predicting_tickets.R, was used to predict the amount of tickets issued in a day based on several factors. This, too, will eventually be a blog post.

I've included the tableau workbooks and the pictures generated by tableau, too, if you are interested.

Lastly, there is the raw data (data.tar.xz) and the gis data (gis_data.csv) which was uploaded to tableau and used to build the pictures you see here as well.
